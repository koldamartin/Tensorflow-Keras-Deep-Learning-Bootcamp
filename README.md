# Tensorflow-Keras-Deep-Learning-Bootcamp
These are notebooks from excercises from a Udemy Course. https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/
During the course I learned about neural networks architecture, ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, NLP, AutoEncoders, GAN and how to code it using Tensorflow/Keras framework. 

These excercises I coded myself:

1. Basic artificial neural networks - Classification task on tabular data.

2. Convolutional neural networks - Image classification on Fashion MNIST dataset.

3. Recurrent neural networks - Time series prediction using LSTM layers.

4. Generative Adversarial Network
